Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. While a neural network with a single layer can still make approximate predictions, additional hidden layers can help to optimize and refine for accuracy.

Convolutional Neural Networks are Deep Learning Networks which work best for image data. CNN uses convolutional filters to extract images from the data.Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are:

- Convolutional layer
- Pooling layer
- Fully-connected (FC) layer

In this project, we use different architectures and hyperparameters of the CNN and DNN Models to identify which models works best for our data. The model is checked on the training and validation accuracy. Finally the best model is used on the new test data.
